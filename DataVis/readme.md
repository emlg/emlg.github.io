# Data visualization Project
## Visualize Cryptocurrencies in a new way
### Olivier Couque, Emma Lejal Glaude & Matthieu Sauv√©

In this repository you will find the code and the data for our project.

To see the visualization, go to : http://emlg.github.io/DataVis <br>
From here you will be able to access both modes of our data visualization as well as a direct link to the code (present in this repository), the process book (also present here) and the screencast of the visualization (available on youtube).<br>

To retrace our work : <br>
In the data folder, you will find the original data on which we have worked.

Our preprocessing and exploratory analysis can be found on the Jupyter Notebook crypto_cleaning.ipynb, available in this repository.
To visualize the notebook : http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/emlg/emlg.github.io/blob/master/DataVis/crypto_cleaning.ipynb <br>

The file resulting from this preprocessing is crypto_prices.csv, available in this repository.
The overview of the exploratory analysis can be found in the process book. <br>
The last element is the code : you will find the code of both modes in their corresponding folders. Each of them contains a Javascript, a HTML and a CSS files. Both modes requires the "crypto_prices.csv" file and the folder named "logos".
